# VQA-MCB

This is the classical Visual Question Answering task that I coded with the MCB Idea.

It is basically the baseline of VQA task by this paper () but with the modification that instead of concatenating, we convolute the two vectors of RNN state output and Feature maps extracted from the image from the VGG19 pretrained network, in a specific amount of frequency domain, which extended gives more accuracy to the model.
